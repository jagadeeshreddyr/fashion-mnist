# Fashion MNIST Classification

In this project, a machine learning model was developed and trained using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset comprises grayscale images of various clothing items, each categorized into one of 10 classes. The primary objective of the project was to create a model capable of accurately classifying these clothing items based on their images.

## Model Training

The machine learning model was trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset, which includes 60,000 training images. Throughout the training process, the model learns to recognize patterns and features in the images that are indicative of different clothing items. This learning is facilitated by optimization algorithms such as gradient descent, which adjusts the model's parameters to minimize prediction errors.

## Performance Metrics

Following model training, its performance was evaluated on both the training and test datasets. The training set accuracy, indicating the model's performance on the data it was trained on, was measured at 0.97. This suggests that the model correctly classified 97% of the images in the training set.

Conversely, the test set accuracy assesses the model's performance on unseen data. In this project, the test set accuracy was found to be 0.90, implying that the model accurately classified 90% of the images in the test set.

## Generalization

The obtained metrics from both the training and test sets offer insights into the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. While a high training set accuracy suggests effective learning of underlying patterns, the test set accuracy serves as a more reliable indicator of the model's true performance on unseen data.

In this scenario, the high test set accuracy of 0.90 demonstrates the model's capability to generalize well to new images of clothing items. This suggests its potential for accurately classifying clothing items in real-world scenarios, making it a valuable tool for applications such as e-commerce, inventory management, and fashion recommendation systems.
